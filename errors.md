1. Remember to `from collections import defaultdict`
2. Remember to initialize defaultdict - for instance, to get defaultdict with integers, do `defaultdict(int)`
3. STRINGS ARE IMMUTABLE
4. You can't just convert a list to a str with str(), use "".join
5. ALWAYS in order to invert some boolean in Python, use "not"
